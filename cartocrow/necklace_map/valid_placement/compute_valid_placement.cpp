/**@class ComputeValidPlacement
 * @brief A functor to compute a valid placement for a collection of necklace beads.
 *
 * A placement for a set of necklace beads is a set of angles that describes the position of each bead on the necklace. A placement is valid if all scaled beads are inside their feasible interval and the distance between any two beads is at least some non-negative buffer distance. Note that this buffer distance guarantees that the beads do not overlap.
 *
 * There is often a range of valid placements. In this case, the placement is guided by an attraction-repulsion force: the beads are attracted to the center of their interval and repelled by the neighboring beads.
 *
 * Note that the placements are computed independently per necklace. This means that if a map contains multiple necklaces, no guarantees can be given about overlap of beads on different necklaces. However, such overlap can often be prevented manually by tuning the attraction-replusion force and the buffer distance.
